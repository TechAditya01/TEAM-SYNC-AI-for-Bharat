# 🚨 Nagar Alert System (Team SYNC)
> **Revolutionizing Civic Issue Reporting with AI-Powered WhatsApp Bot & Real-Time Dashboard**

##  Problem Statement
City infrastructures suffer because reporting issues (potholes, garbage, waterlogging) is tedious. Citizens don't want to install another app. **Nagar Alert** solves this by letting anyone report issues via **WhatsApp**, powered by AI for verification and classification.
